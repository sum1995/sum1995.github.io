## Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD student working in the field of computational sciences. I am currently working at the department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. Prior to this, I completed my master in science in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from National Institute of Technology, Warangal.

My research area includes Ocean modelling of shallow water flow and inertial gravity waves using finite element method. For finite element implementation i am using our lab's inhouse package ParMooN(Parallel Mathematics and object oriented Numerics). It is an open source finite element package for the scalable (parallel) solution of partial differential equations.



I am particularly interested in the higher-order numerical schemes and different solution strategies for conservation laws. Some of the applications include shallow water dynamics, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Gasdynamics, Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) and highway traffic modeling. In addition to this, my research interests include high performance computing, data driven approach to CFD and uncertainty quantification. Apart from research, I enjoy reading, photography, trekking and pencil sketching.
