## Welcome to my website!

---

I am a PhD student working in the field of computational sciences. I am currently working under  <a href = "http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/sashi/" target = "blank"> <b>Prof. Sashi Kumaar Ganesan</b> </a> at the department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. Prior to this, I completed my master in science in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from National Institute of Technology, Warangal.

My research area includes Ocean modelling of shallow water flow and inertial gravity waves using finite element method. For finite element implementation i am using our lab's inhouse package ParMooN(Parallel Mathematics and object oriented Numerics). It is an open source finite element package for the scalable (parallel) solution of partial differential equations.



In addition to this, my research interests include Computational Fluid dynamics,Finite element Methods, Geophysical fluid dynamics,high performance computing, data driven approach to CFD, Atmospheric Modelling. Apart from research, I enjoy traveling, Sports,trekking, fashion modelling and cooking.

##### Description
<p align="justify">
The objective is to use data visualization tools available in the python library <b>matplotlib</b>. The data used is the state-wise Police Complaint Registration Statistics of 2009 of all Indian States and U.Ts. It is available at <a href="https://www.data.gov.in" target="blank">https://www.data.gov.in</a> and was published by <a href="http://www.ncrb.gov.in" target="blank">http://www.ncrb.gov.in</a>, both part of Ministry of Home Affairs of Indian Government. The data gives the statistics of the method of complaint registration (oral/written/helpline/suomoto by police) and the category in which complaint is registered (IPC or SLL).I used <b>scatter plot</b>, <b>box plot</b> and <b>bar chart</b> to analyse the data and draw inference. The links to the <b>Result</b> and <b>Github repository</b> are given above.
