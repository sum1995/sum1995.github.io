## About me
---

Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD student working in the field of computational sciences. I am currently working at the department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. Prior to this, I completed my master in science in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from National Institute of Technology, Warangal.

My research area includes Ocean modelling of shallow water flow and inertial gravity waves using finite element method. For finite element implementation i am using our lab's inhouse package ParMooN(Parallel Mathematics and object oriented Numerics). It is an open source finite element package for the scalable (parallel) solution of partial differential equations.



I am particularly interested in the higher-order numerical schemes and different solution strategies for conservation laws. Some of the applications include shallow water dynamics, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Gasdynamics, Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) and highway traffic modeling. In addition to this, my research interests include high performance computing, data driven approach to CFD and uncertainty quantification. Apart from research, I enjoy reading, photography, trekking and pencil sketching.

## Current Project

### Pressure scaling of reheat flame structure
In this work, we are doing direct numerical simulations at different pressure levels (1, 5 and 10 bar) to understand pressure scaling of reheat flame structure. And also quantify the distribution of fractional fuel consumption rate on different modes of combustion using chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA). 

## Past Projects

### Thermal Energy storage Battery using Phase Change Material
Battery storage of thermal energy was designed using phase change material. Simulations were performed on STAR CCM+ to compare different heat exchangers and final designed was analyzed using self developed experiment setup. 


### Designing of vapor chamber and heat sink for air cooling of laser
Vapor chamber with given dimension constraints and heat flux was designed with the thorough literature review. Along with this, Heat sink was designed with pin fin. Other configuration with rectangular fin was also considered but it was not efficient as per the requirement.


### Gym Powered RO purifier
Reverse osmosis water purified was developed which was powered from a gym equipment (cycle for this project). Most of the parts were used from existing RO purifier exploiting interchangeability.
